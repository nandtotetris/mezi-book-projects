  The field a condensed numerical representation of the results of various checks. Not all checks are always carried out.
  Possible values:
  0 = all supported checks were done and passed.
  1 = a subaccount number was automatically appended.
  2 = Account number does not contain a checksum.
  4 = Checksum was not checked.
  8 = Bank code was not checked.
  32 = Warning: a subaccount number may need to be appended, but the necessity of this could not be automatically verified. Please verify manually.
  128 = Checksum error in account number.
  256 = Bankcode not found in directory.
  512 = IBAN has incorrect length.
  1024 = Bank code has incorrect length.
  2048 = The IBAN checksum is incorrect (3rd and 4th characters of the IBAN)
  4096 = Missing input data (for example, the country code).
  8192 = Country not yet supported.

  Interpretation: if the sum is:
  < 32. Result can be assumed correct;
  32 ≤ sum ≤ 127. Result might be correct but should be verified;
  ≥ 128. There may be a more serious error.
